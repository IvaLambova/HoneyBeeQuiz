# HoneyBeeQuiz
This app was developed as part of the Udacity -- Google Android Basics Scollarship Challenge.
The aim of the app is to provide an educational quiz containing ten questions in a variety of formats such as free text response, checkboxes, and radio buttons.
The app includes a button for the user to submit their answers and receive a score as well as a reset button to clear all the answers and start over.
To overcome the screen rotation challenges the app uses a scrollable feature.	
The grading logic checks each answer and calculates the number of correct answers and does not include incorrect answers in the count.
It finally displays the score in a Toast message after clicking the submit button.
The app supports Bulgarian language.
